When you add a website to your list, time.ly will automatically start a timer for it. Anytime your active tab is on one of these websites, the timer will continue.

Timers will only continue if Chrome has focus. Additionally, all timers will restart once the total time hits 24 hours.

Key features:
- Set up alerts to remind you to go back to work after a certain time has been spent on a website
- Download your data as a CSV file
- See the percentage of your total work time spent on your websites
